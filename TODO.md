# TODO: Add Friends Page to Side Navbar

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the sidebar and found the "Friends" link already exists in Sidebar.jsx
- [x] Checked App.jsx and confirmed the "/friends" route was missing
- [x] Created FriendsPage.jsx that fetches friends using getUserFriends() API
- [x] Added FriendCard components for displaying friends and NoFriendsFound for empty state
- [x] Added import for FriendsPage in App.jsx
- [x] Added the "/friends" route in App.jsx with proper authentication and layout

## Summary
The friends page has been successfully added to the side navbar. The sidebar already had the link, but the route and page component were missing. Now, users can navigate to "/friends" to view their friends list, with proper loading states and empty state handling.
